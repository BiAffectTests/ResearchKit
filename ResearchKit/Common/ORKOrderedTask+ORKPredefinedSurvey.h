/**
 Returns a predefined survey that asks the user questions about their mood and general health.
 
 The mood survey includes questions about the daily or weekly mental and physical health status and
 includes asking about clarity of thinking, overall mood, pain, sleep and exercise. Additionally,
 the survey is setup to allow for an optional custom question that uses a similar-looking set of images
 as the other questions.
 
 @param identifier              The task identifier to use for this task, appropriate to the study.
 @param intendedUseDescription  A localized string describing the intended use of the data collected. If the value of this parameter is `nil`, the default localized text is displayed.
 @param frequency               How frequently the survey is asked (daily or weekly).
 @param customQuestionText      A localized string to use for a custom question. If `nil`, this step is not included.
 @param options                 Options that affect the features of the predefined task.
